# CLIPERNATOR — Design Reference

## General Notes
- "Entities" usually refers to both the player and enemies, but can also refer to bosses or projectiles
- Goal is to make floor 1 & 2 as good as possible before adding more floors
- I am trying to make this a actually good game, I do not want to cut any corners
- When suggesting changes, tell me what part of the code to add or change, do not remake entire files unless necessary
- This document should be updated after any signifcant changes
- Sometimes game states are modified for play testing. I'm not playing 30 minutes until wave 19 to see if mirror maze is reflectable with bowling balls.

- want MS Sans Serif to be used for most of the UI, and for fixedsys to be used in a few specific areas, like how microsoft did it: MS Sans Serif was a bitmap, proportional UI font used for Windows interface text in early Windows versions, and Microsoft Sans Serif later replaced it as the TrueType successor distributed with Windows 2000 and later. In practice, this family was used for dialog boxes, labels, and general interface text rather than code-like text areas. Fixedsys was a bitmap, monospaced font originally used as the system font in Windows 1.0 and 2.0, and later it remained the default font in Notepad through the Windows 9x/ME era. It was mainly associated with old-style text display and legacy editor use rather than general GUI text.
- When you press the minimize button the game just closes and becomes a tiny tab in the middle of the screen. this is funny and should be kept.
- The MGW (main game window) and the simulated offscreen windows are part of the game world, not separate OS windows or separate game simulations.

## Item Rules
1. Items can be permanent or temporary
2. Items can affect the player, enemies, environment, or a combination
3. Items can have only positive effects, or both positive and negative effects (never only negative)
4. Items can and should interact with each other
5. Item names should be at least loosely related to their effect

- **Bowling Balls** 🎳 — Pierces enemies, damages each one it passes through (no b.life = 0 on hit)
   - Explodes on expiry/too many bounces
   - Reflectable by glowstick (already handled since tickMeleeWindow iterates gs.bullets — just needs to not skip isBowlingBall)
   - Mirror shard hit → redirected ball + spawn second ball toward nearest enemy
   - Grey preview circle at gun tip while queued

## Glowsticks / Melee
- Right-click or F to activate
- everything reflected is explosive
- Activates an instant hitbox box in front of the player for `MELEE_ACTIVE_FRAMES` frames
- Zero delay between button press and hitbox being live
- Reflects enemy bullets and raging ring bullets toward the player's cursor as explosive shots
- Cannonball enemies can be redirected by glowstick at any time (not just while charging)
- **No cooldown on successful reflect** — cooldown only applies on miss
- Brief game freeze (explosionFreezeTimer) on successful reflect
- Melee also damages enemies in front for baseDamage * 3

## Enemy Behaviors

### Floor 1
- **Utensil** (fork/knife/spoon) — body drifts toward player; orbiting utensil launches at player on a timer; knife bleeds, spoon knocks back, fork grabs and slows
- **Water Balloon** — moves around randomly and fires gravity-affected bullets at the player
- **Gift Box** — slow wind-up explosion on proximity; player can grab and throw it
- **Party Hat** — fast, periodically speed-dives at player
- **Cake Boss** (wave 11) — multi-phase: candle shots, spin bounce, frosting arc balls; loses a candle per HP threshold; at 1 candle enters permanent spiral

### Floor 2


- **Cannonball** — telegraphs then charges across arena; can be reflected by glowstick at any time into an explosion
- **Ringmaster** — flees player, buffs nearby enemies (speed, size, damage, HP); enemies in aura long enough reach Critical Mass (immune to explosives, 3x damage, explode on contact)
- **Juggler** — captures nearby enemies and juggles them; throws arc balls and captured enemies at player; orbits ringmaster if one is nearby
- Clown car - drives around and throws clowns
- Clowns - chases enemies, gives them extra speed when on them
- **Boss 2** (wave 26) — spiral, summon, and volley phases; phase 2 at 50% HP

## Offscreen Windows (Prototype)

- Enemies that move beyond the MGW's world bounds get an in-page floating window that renders the shared game scene around them. Enemies still update and interact through the normal simulation; the window is another camera/view, not a separate arena.
- Nearby offscreen enemies can share a window. Their title lists the enemy types, and the camera frames the group. Enemy windows can be dragged; dragging moves the contained enemies and their world positions together.
- When an enemy window overlaps the MGW, its enemies merge back into the MGW. Moving the MGW does not directly move offscreen windows or their entities.
- Clippy gets a non-draggable window while outside the MGW. Clippy remains controllable and can aim/shoot using the offscreen view. Remaining outside costs 3 HP per second.
- The utensil's launched attacks can travel beyond the MGW boundary, and fork-thrown enemies are not immediately clamped back into it. These changes are scoped to utensil attacks and fork throws; they do not yet guarantee that every projectile or enemy mechanic works seamlessly across all window boundaries.
- Mini-window canvases have a black background. The grid is still drawn only over the MGW's world bounds; it does not extend across the full mini-window view.
- Treat cross-window behavior as experimental. Review mechanics that assume the MGW bounds are hard arena walls (projectile culling, collision, enemy cleanup, knockback, boss attacks, and merge positioning) before expanding this system to more enemy types or relying on it for balance.

## Sound Effects

Sound effects are registered in `jsstuff/sounds.js`. “Wired” means the sound is currently triggered by the listed game event; “unused” means the file is present but has no gameplay hook yet.

### Player

| File | Intended event / status |
|---|---|
| `PlayerDamage.mp3` | Wired: player takes damage from enemy contact or a hostile projectile. |
| `ClippyDamage.mp3` | Wired: Clippy takes damage; used alongside `PlayerDamage` on relevant hits. |
| `ClippyDeath.mp3` | Wired: game over. |
| `ClippySpeak.mp3` | Wired: plays with Clippy’s randomized reaction whenever paying Chippy’s health cost. |
| `NotAllowed.mp3` | Wired: plays when an attempted interaction cannot succeed under current conditions, such as Chippy rejecting a health payment, Chippy being out of range or busy, Glowsticks being on cooldown, or using the prize wheel on the wrong floor or without enough tickets. |

| `RelicAquire.mp3` | Wired: Glowsticks, the current permanent relic/upgrade, are unlocked. Filename spelling matches the asset. |

### Bullets

| File | Intended event / status |
|---|---|
| `NormalHit1.mp3`, `NormalBulletHit.mp3` | Wired: ordinary player bullet hits an enemy; randomized between the two available impact sounds. |

| `Chippy/ChippyClick.mp3` | Wired: repeated spin cue during Chippy’s long spin; cues become progressively farther apart as it slows. No sound is used during Produce until a separate sound is available. |
| `Chippy/ChippyFinish.mp3` | Wired: the long spin reaches its final frame and stops. |
| `Chips/ChipPickup.mp3` | Wired: a normal chip is collected. |
| `Chips/GoldenChipTarget.mp3` | Wired as a loop: plays while at least one golden chip is magnetized and homing toward the player. |
| `Chips/GoldenChipPickup.mp3` | Wired: a golden chip is collected, including from Chippy. |
| `items/ItemConfirm.mp3` | Wired: confirms an item in the opening draft or in-game choice, and plays when an item is picked up or Glowsticks are unlocked. |
| `items/BirthdayParty/BirthdayParty.mp3` | Wired: intended to play when the Birthday Party item effect activates and freezes enemy movement. The current file is 1 byte and needs valid audio data to be audible. |
